            Malang is a melting pot of cultures and languages. It's mix of residents and tourists lead to unique combinations and every tech group inherits this diversity. Much like Amsterdam, our development community is also diverse in many aspects, from our origins and culture to our choice of framework and language.
        </p>

        <p>
            AmsterdamPHP wishes to create a friendly environment for every developer it encounters, everyone should feel comfortable and safe in our events and online community. More than that we wish this community to be a meeting point, a place where you can come and make new friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            Founded by a mix of expats and dutch organizers, this spirit has been worked on since our very beginning, helping expat developers find a safe place to meet peers and grow a better network and exposing the local community to new ideas and content. Along with this philosophy we also focus on informal meetups such as our drink-ups and game nights to step away from just technology and allow our members to bond and create friendships.
        </p>

        <p>
            This CoC is a formalization of our beliefs, it is here to offer to you, our member, the guarantee that we will do our best to provide you with a safe environment in which to grow your knowledge base and your network.
